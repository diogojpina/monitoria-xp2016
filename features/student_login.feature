Feature: Login Student
    In order to login the system/apply for teaching assistant
    As a student
    I want to login in the system

    Scenario: Valid credentials
        Given I'm at the student login page
        And there is a student with name "carlinhos" and password "12345678" and nusp "123456" and gender "1" and rg "123" and cpf "321" and address "matao" and district "butanta" and zipcode "000" and city "sp" and state "sp" and tel "0123456789" and cel "1234567890" and email "eu@usp.br" and has_bank_account "true"
        When I fill the "NÃºmero USP" field with "123456"
        And I fill the "Senha" field with "12345678"
        And I press the "Entrar" button
        Then I should see "Acesso efetuado com sucesso."
