Feature: Invalid login
    In order to test the login
    As an administrator
    I want to fail the login

    Scenario: Invalid email
        Given I'm at the login page
        And there is an admin user with email "kazuo@ime.usp.br" and password "admin123"
        When I fill the "Email" field with "kazuo@ime.br"
        And I fill the "Senha" field with "admin123"
        And I press the "Entrar" button
        Then I should see "Credenciais inválidas."

    Scenario: Invalid Senha
